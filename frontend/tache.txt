histoire chef athmane (✈️ From Algeria to Chicago — The Journey of a Global Chef 🌍



🇩🇿 Algeria — Where It All Began

I grew up in Algeria, where the kitchen was the heart of every home. That’s where I learned the fundamentals: honest flavors, the beauty of family gatherings, and the discipline that comes with real hospitality. The beginning was humble, but the dream was anything but small.



🇦🇪 Dubai — A Taste of Luxury

My journey took me to Dubai, where I joined Emaar and had the honor of cooking for high-profile guests — even the President of the UAE.

Working at the Taj Hotel taught me how food can be more than a meal — it can be an experience that people feel, not just taste.



🇺🇸 New York — The School of Excellence

From Dubai, I headed to New York to work with world-renowned chef Jean-Georges. That chapter refined my craft — precision, discipline, and respect for every tiny detail that turns a dish into a masterpiece.



🏙️ Chicago — Where the Dream Grows

Today, I’ve made Chicago my home. I cooked at La Salle Hotel before joining the team of legendary Italian chef Fabio Viviani.

Here, I developed my signature style — simple, bold flavors that blend my Algerian roots with a global touch. I became known for my grilled meats, especially lamb, which has become my culinary signature.



🚀 Algeria → Dubai → New York → Chicago

My story isn’t just about places — it’s about passion, resilience, and growing alongside some of the world’s best.

Now, as a Private & Luxury Chef, I create exclusive dining experiences and share my journey with the world.)
