        I was born into a very artistic family, a family where the hands were
        everywhere: a grandmother who was a cook, a grandfather who was a
        sculptor, a mother passionate about sewing, and a father who was a
        musician.

          <p>
            Collages, lithographs, bronzes, plates... The works of Chef Athman
            are a visual translation of his passion for beauty and skill: a play
            of colors and textures that can be found both in frames and on the
            plate. They reflect the influence of nature and the importance of
            the eye in the creation of a recipe.
